<big>Capstone project</big>

In addition, there is also a substantial capstone project I have completed:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Title:</b> Costs and Benefits of VPK Expansion in Florida</li>
<li><b>Description:</b> Florida's voluntary pre-kindergarten program currently only provides resources to 4 year olds. As a group we determined the costs and benefits of possibly expanding Florida's VPK eligibility to include 3 year olds as well. Full details can be found in the report. Our conclusion was in favor of a potential expansion of the program. (A link to the oral presentation given at a symposium is available upon request)</li>
